# Training log

Each day has one entry. At the start of the day, record the goal and anything left over from the previous day.
At the end of the day, record what shipped (merge requests, artifacts, screenshots). The "For the retro" list
is used on Day 15.

## Day 00: 2026-10-13

Goal: prepare the practice environment.
Left over from the previous day: -
Shipped (merge requests, artifacts, screenshots):
- Repository `ai-tools-training`, branch `develop`; training app `practice/tally` runs locally with tests and CI.
- Ticket board in `practice/tally/tickets/` with 18 tickets in `backlog/`, reported by simulated roles.
Observations (positive / negative):
- Several rounds of corrections on conventions (English-only files, neutral tone, ticket board), now recorded in
  `CLAUDE.md` so later sessions start from them.
For the retro:
- Writing conventions down in `CLAUDE.md` early avoids repeating the same corrections.
Open before the next day:
- [ ] Sign in to claude.ai, Claude Desktop and the Claude mobile app
- [ ] Push `develop` to GitLab, set it as the default branch, enable a CI runner and confirm the pipeline passes
- [ ] Run Prompt A (`practice/tally/PRACTICE.md`) in a separate session to create the seeded bug tickets
- [ ] Select the Day 11 role: web (Windows)

## Day 01: 2026-10-14

Goal: mental model and Claude basics; run the app from a clean clone; seed bugs for Days 2-3.
Left over from the previous day: the Day 00 sign-in, GitLab push and CI items and the Day 11 role choice are still
open.
Shipped (merge requests, artifacts, screenshots):
- Clean clone of `develop` verified: `npm ci`, typecheck, 103 unit and API tests and 6 e2e tests pass.
- Bug seeding (Prompt A) run in an isolated subagent: five `source::seeded` tickets in `tickets/backlog/`
  (`weighted_split_share_off`, `expense_date_previous_day`, `guest_can_delete_expense`,
  `large_group_expense_rejected`, `expense_list_wrong_payer`). The answer key stays outside the repository, unread.
- `docs/day-01-setup`: README note on the Windows path length limit for the local D1 database.
Observations (positive / negative):
- The first clean clone, in a deep temporary folder, failed at `npm run db:migrate` with `internal error` and no
  hint about the cause. Measuring the path showed that the D1 file passed the 260-character Windows limit; a short
  path worked. Running the setup from scratch found a problem the existing checkout could not show.
For the retro:
- "Works on my machine" includes the folder path; a clean-clone check belongs in onboarding.
Open before the next day:
- [ ] Day 01 exercise in Claude chat: three real work questions (a bug summary, an explanation, a draft) and the
  prompt changes that improved each answer
- [ ] Git block on GitLab: clone, branch, commit, push
- [ ] Push `develop` with the seeded commits so that feature branches start from them
